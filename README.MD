The Simon Game Mini is a web-based implementation of the classic memory game where players are challenged to recall and replicate an increasingly complex sequence of colors. The game begins with a single color lighting up, and with each successful round, an additional color is added to the sequence. The objective is to follow the sequence correctly as it becomes progressively harder, testing and improving memory and concentration skills.
